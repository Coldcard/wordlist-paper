# BIP39 Wordlist on Paper

Uses python's "reportlab" to make a PDF file of 4 pages, containing every English
BIP-39 seed word, and their hex value.

Could be cut into squares for drawing from a hat... or for looking up values to do
your own math.

Hexidecimal number that each words represents is shown in the corner.

Look here for the final PDF ready to go: [wordlist.pdf](wordlist.pdf)


# Seed XOR Worksheets and Explainer

This repo is also holding some code to explain how to XOR two or more
seed phrases together, using your hands... fully airgapped.

See [xor-example.md](xor-example.md)

The worksheet to go with this is still in progress.
