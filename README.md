# BIP39 Wordlist on Paper

Use python's "reportlab" to make a PDF file of 4 pages, containing every English
BIP-39 seed word, and their hex value.

Could be cut into squares for drawing from a hat... or for looking up values to do
your own math.

Hexidecimal number that each words represents is shown in the corner.

Look here for the final PDF ready to go: [wordlist.pdf](wordlist.pdf)

# Seed XOR Worksheets and Explainer

This repo is also holds some code to explain how to XOR two or more
seed phrases together, using your hands... fully airgapped.

See [xor-example.md](xor-example.md)

To follow along, or to use this paper method yourself, you may want to use this worksheet:

You will need the wordlist as reference as well.

# Security

Be sure to completely destroy any paper materials used in your work. They
contain your master secret and could be used to steal your funds! It's best
to burn them after use.
